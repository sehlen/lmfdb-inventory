### Collection dimension_table
This collection contains two types of records.
#### Gamma1: Fields
The first type is for a space of modular forms for Gamma_1(N).
* level: the level
* weight: the weight
* d_eis: The dimension of the space of Eisenstein series E_k(Gamma_1(N))
* d_mod: The dimension of the space of all modular forms M_k(Gamma_1(N))
* d_newf: The dimension of the space of all cuspidal newforms in S_k(Gamma_1(N))
* gamma1_label: A label for the space, of the form level.weight
* all_in_db: True if the spaces S_k^{new}(N,chi) for all chi are in the db, False otherwise
* one_in_db: True if at least one of these spaces is in the db

#### Gamma0 with character: Fields
The second type of record is for a space with a specified character.
* level: The level (N)
* weight The weight (k)
* cchi: The character number (Conrey naming scheme)
* space_label: level.weight.cchi
* space_orbit_label: level.weight.i, where i is the index of the Galois orbit of the character in the list of Galois orbits of characters of this level. The Galois orbits are ordered by the minimal number appearing in the orbit.
* character_orbit: The (Conrey) numbers of all characters in the Galois orbit
* character_orbit_rep: A representative for the orbit - this is the minimal number appearing in character_orbit
* character_parity: 1 if the character is even, -1 if it is odd
* d_cusp: The dimension of the space of cusp forms S_k(N, chi), where N is the level, chi is the character specified by cchi.
* d_eis: The dimension of the space of Eisenstein series E_k(N,chi)
* d_newf: The dimension of the space of (cuspidal) newforms in S_k(N,chi)
* in_msdb: 1 if we have this space in the modular symbols database, which stores sage modular symbols spaces, else 0
* in_wdb: 1 if we have this space in the web database, i.e. an entry exists in the collection webmodformspace and all galois orbits of newforms are stored in the collection webnewforms

#### Indexes

* [(u'_id', 1)] (created by mongo)
* [(u'level', 1), (u'weight', 1)] (used to display the browse table)
* [(u'weight', 1)] (used to search by weight)
* [(u'level', 1)] (used to search by level)
* [(u'level', 1), (u'weight', 1), (u'character_orbit_rep', 1)] (this is a sparse index because character_orbit_rep is not existent for all records and it is also unique. This is used to make sure that this combination is unique as we only store one record for each Galois orbit as of now and there have been duplicates in the past leading to problems.)
